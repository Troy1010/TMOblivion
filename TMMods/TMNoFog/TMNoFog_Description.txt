This mod is meant to remove distance fog from LOD objects.
I thought it was very awkward that the objects would look grey, but the mountains themselves didn't.

This mod achieves this through script, but it's probably more performant and would avoid sudden graphical changes that could possibly happen.
However, this should work no matter what, even with OblivionReloaded adding weathers in a weird way.
