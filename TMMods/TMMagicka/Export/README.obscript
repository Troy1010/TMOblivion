;This mod is meant to make magicka more scarce.
;It is supposed to be used alongside other mods that give more access to mana potions and such.
;It also can make spell costs more uniform. (Am I sure I want that?)
;
;Known bug: When casting at low mana, the spell might fizzle, even after subtracting mana.
