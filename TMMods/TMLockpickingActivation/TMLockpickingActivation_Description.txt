This mod is meant to make it so that players with novice lockpicking can't pick as many locks.
OOO already does this to an extent, but only for the boxes that have the OOO scripts. It also isn't configurable.

# Implementation Comments
The current implementation just closes the menu after it is opened.
But, it might a good idea to disable the activation control, instead.
It also might need a different implementation if using a mod which makes lockpicking live.
It also might be a good idea to disable the OOO mirror feature.
