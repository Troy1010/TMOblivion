Frost Atronarch - smaller (so they can fit in the caves they live in)
Rat - smaller, faster
Staff Effects (Oblivion War Cry) - DmgHealth instead of DrainHealth (So enemies don't just keep casting drain health at you like morons)
Ingredients (Cobl Main, OOO, MMM, Better Cities) - Removed effects from most edibles. Replaced a lot of useless effects. Made a few edits.
FatigueJump - changes how much fatigue jumping costs
