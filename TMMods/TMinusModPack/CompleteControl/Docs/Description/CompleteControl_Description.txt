# Features
Keeps track of how many mods disabled a key, and only enables the key when all mods have done so.
	For instance, it helps with this situation:
		Mod A disables key 10
		Mod B disables key 10
		Mod B enables key 10
		! Oh no! Mod A expects that key 10 is still disabled, but it isn't!

# Install
Requires OBSE
Extract the mod's zip into Oblivion/

#
Keep in mind that this mod is still alpha. There are lots of things that could still be better, like the install process, ini options, docs, etc.
