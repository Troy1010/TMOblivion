# Summary
This mod is based on these ideas:
	- Sprinting is a nice game feature.
	- Fatigue management should be important, and its importance should not disappear when you level up.
	- Your top skills should represent your character's abilities in a broader sense.

# Features
When holding the RunWalk key and only the forward key Then the player will sprint, gaining speed and draining Fatigue.
Jumping drains less Fatigue.
Fatigue regen is overhauled.
	It is based on a combination of:
		-how many of your top 6 skills are athletics, blade, block, blunt, handToHand, heavyArmor, acrobatics, lightArmor, marksman, sneak.
		-if you are standing still, walking, running, or sprinting
		-

# Install
Extract the mod's zip into Oblivion/
Put after any mod that adjusts the Fatigue game settings.
(These install instructions might not be complete)

Keep in mind that this mod is still alpha. There are lots of things that could still be better, like the install process, ini options, docs, etc.
This mod might negate some functionality of, for example, star signs that rely on fFatigueReturnMult or something. I might fix that later on, but again, it's still alpha.
Feel free to make edits and re-release something similar. I know it's an opinionated mod, and I didn't add many ini options.
