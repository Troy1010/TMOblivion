This mod helps debugging by doing things like:
	Printing menu identifiers
	Making the player speedier and turning on TCL so they can quickly get to a bugged cell
	Immediately starting a new game when Oblivion loads

See DebugHelper.ini for a complete list.

I've forgotten what the Dev file is for..
