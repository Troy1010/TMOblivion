DontDie creates a penalty for dying.
The entire mod is activated by 2 events.
On Save,
		the save is given a SaveID and is registered to m2dSaveEntries that holds a ManualEditingString, a DeathCount, a GMTimestamp, and an array of NearbySaveIDs.
        Then, all registered saves are scanned and those that are "nearby" get the newly generated SaveID added to their NearbySaveIDs.
		The entire m2dSaveEntries is then stored in a DeathLog text file (The DeathLogs can be found in ...\Data\ConScribe Logs\Per-Mod\).
On player death, 
		The NearbySaveIDs for the current SaveID are scanned. If they are in range, their DeathCount++.
Then, the mod dispatches 2 events.
	EVENTDeathPenaltyInGame: Passes iDeathCount. Happens a few frames after loading is finished. This allows stability for handler's reference-modifying functions.
	EVENTDeathPenaltyPostLoad: Passes iDeathCount. Happens before the first frame is shown. This allows the handlers to not be delayed.
These events are contained within DontDie's esp.. so anyone wishing to register to the events would have to take DontDie as a master.

The DeathLogs can be found in ...\Data\ConScribe Logs\Per-Mod\
A new DeathLog is generated on NewGame. That way, multiple characters will not affect each other's deaths.
The LogCountLog keeps track of what code to give the next log.
The user can manually change the DeathCount for a save by opening the DeathLog for his character and modifying the number in the DeathCount column.

**Feature Ideas
>Make DontDie not reliant on ConScribe
>Add notes to the DeathLogs so that the user can more easily make manual edits.
**Notes
>You can't keep the player name in the name of the DeathLog because then it creates a new log whenever the player's name is changed. (especially at NewGame)
