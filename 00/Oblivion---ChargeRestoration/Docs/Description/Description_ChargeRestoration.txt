This mod recharges weapons that have spent time near a well.

It works by triggering an event on sleep or on cell changed.
This event records a timestamp for any nearby wells.
The next time the well is seen by this event, the timestamp is used to recharge nearby items.

This method is inaccurate, and will recharge items as if they had been left by the well as soon as the last time
the player had triggered the event handler. It also means that items will not recharge unless an
event is triggered. I'm also unsure if I need to add a "wait" handler?
