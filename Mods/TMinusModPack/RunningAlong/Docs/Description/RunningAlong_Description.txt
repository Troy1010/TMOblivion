# Summary
This mod is based on these ideas:
	-Sprinting is a nice game feature.
	-Fatigue management should be important, and its importance should not disappear when you level up.
	-Character should be required to specialize.. they can't be the best warrior, best rogue, and best wizard all at the same time.
	-Backwards running at full speed makes it a bit too easy to kite.

# Features
No backwards running
When holding the RunWalk key and only the forward key Then the player will sprint, gaining speed and draining Fatigue.
Player falls when fatigue is 0
Player fatigue drains/regenerates according to:
	-How many of your top 6 skills are athletics, blade, block, blunt, handToHand, heavyArmor, acrobatics, lightArmor, marksman, sneak.
	-If you are standing still, walking, running, or sprinting
	-Configurable ini values, such as:
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileStandingIfCompletelyFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileWalkingIfCompletelyFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileRunningIfCompletelyFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileSprintingIfCompletelyFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileStandingIfCompletelyNotFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileWalkingIfCompletelyNotFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileRunningIfCompletelyNotFit
		secondsUntilFullRegenWhileSprintingIfCompletelyNotFit
Jumping drains only 1 Fatigue.

Keep in mind that this mod is still alpha. There are lots of things that could still be better, like the install process, ini options, docs, etc.
Feel free to make edits and re-release something similar. I know it's an opinionated mod, and I didn't add many ini options.
