# Features
While bow is drawn, the camera sways
While bow is drawn, when the player clicks the SeathWeapon control, it denocks the arrow
If bow is drawn very briefly, the arrow is denocked

# Developer Notes
Because I figured I might want to make sure other mods could add functionality to SeathWeapon, but not while bow is drawn.. SeathWeapon is disabled while bow is drawn.

# Install
Extract the mod's zip into Oblivion/
Put Tminus1010_^CommonFunctions.esm near the top of the load order
Put Tminus1010_^CommonFunctionsChild.esp near the bottom of the load order
Put TMArchery.esp and CompleteControlHelper.esp in between

Keep in mind that this mod is still alpha. There are lots of things that could still be better, like the install process, ini options, docs, etc.
