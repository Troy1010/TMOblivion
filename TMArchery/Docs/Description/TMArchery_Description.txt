# Features
Bow sways while drawn
While bow is drawn, the SeathWeapon control denocks the arrow
If bow is drawn very briefly, the arrow is simply denocked

# Developer Notes
Because I figured I might want to make sure other mods could add functionality to SeathWeapon, but not while bow is drawn.. SeathWeapon is disabled while bow is drawn.
