CompleteControl adds APIs to help mods manage player controls.
For instance, it helps with this situation:
	Mod A disables key 1
	Mod B disables key 1
	Mod B enables key 1
	! Oh no! Mod A expects that key 1 is still disabled, but it isn't!

I do not remember what CompleteControlHelper.esp is for, or if it is even necessary.

===== Install
Install CompleteControl.7z with MO2
Extract CompleteControl.7z, and copy CompleteControl/Data into Oblivion/
TODO: There is probably a more standard way of doing this.
