# Summary
This mod makes it so that Athletics does not affect movespeed for the player.
It does this because a multiplicative factor in the speed equation has some **undesirable** effects:
	- vulnerable to reaching extreme values.
	- the same Speed buff does not affect everyone in the same way. Characters with high athletics will see a bigger movespeed increase from the same buff.
Unlike other similar mods, it does this only for the player, so that NPCs are not unintentionally slower than they were originally calibrated to be.
It achieves this by adjusting the player's Speed.
