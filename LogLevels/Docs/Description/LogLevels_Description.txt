# Features
Allows modders to write more verbose logs without showing them unless there is configuration to do so.

# Install
Requires OBSE and ConScribe
Extract the plugin's zip into Oblivion/

# Note about Alpha
Keep in mind that this plugin is still alpha. There are lots of things that could still be better, like the install process, ini options, docs, etc.
The intention is to have this plugin work through ConScribe to leverage some of its functionality. However, this first release has not accomplished that to the full extent, yet.

# Note about Log Levels
These are my favorite logging levels:
	Temporary
		Easy, temporary, unrefined, individualized messages. Should not be merged into release.
	Info
		Messages that you assume everyone would always want to see. Not meant to be used often.
	Error
		Something went wrong. Having this separate from "Info" is what allows it to have extra flare, like red text color in some IDEs.
	Warning
		Something might be wrong. Having this separate from "Info" is what allows it to have extra flare, like yellow text color in some IDEs.
	Debug
		Short messages.
	Verbose
		Long messages.
	Flooding
		Messages that write to the log quite often, perhaps every frame.

Generally, I like to keep the log level at WARNING or DEBUG, and freely use TEMPORARY logz while developing. Then, before release, delete or change all TEMPORARY logz to whatever makes sense. That way, I can see very accommodating, individualized logs while developing.. and if I come back later, I can see those old logs by setting the log level to DEBUG or VERBOSE.. but otherwise, they're hidden.

# Example Usage
-Install
-Open a new mod that you're developing
-In a script, use some of the logging commands and set a mod log level.
-Launch Oblivion with your mod running
-Open ConScribe Logs/Static Log.log
You should see the logs that are above the mod log level that you set.
