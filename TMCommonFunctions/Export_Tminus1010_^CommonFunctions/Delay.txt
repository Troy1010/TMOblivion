;*Currently, using -1 for fTimeToWait is the same as using 0.
; I was thinking about adding the functionality that if 0 is used as fTimeToWait, the rScriptToRun runs during the same frame, just at the end of it.
; However, at this time, I cannot think of a real use for that functionality, nor a solid way to implement it.
