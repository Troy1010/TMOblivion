CommonFunctions is a library. It is a master esm that contains functions and dispatches events for its child esps to use.

The CommonFunctionsChild.esp allows CommonFunctions to dispatch events closer to the start of the frame. (the esp last in the load order is run first)

**Initiation Features
*Initiation Events
There are 4 initiation events
 InitOnStart: Once on the first frame of MainMenu.
  UniversalData (aka SetEventHandlers, GameSettings, etc) is recommended to be set here.
 InitPostLoad: Every PostLoad/NewGame.
  SaveData (aka QuestVariables) is recommended to be set here.
 InitMainMenu: Every MainMenu.
  SaveData that is expected to exist during the MainMenu is recommended to be set here.
 InitInGame: A few frames after every PostLoad/NewGame, once references are stable.
  Reference edits (Adding tokens, etc) are recommended here.
If SaveData is set in InitGameLoad||InitMainMenu, it can be expected to always exist.
*Script Initiations
Any child mod's script whose formid ends with "000800" will be scanned during initiation events.
If that script contains a reference to any of the Init functions, it is called.
*Activator Initiations
Some script functions (ie ones that help explicitly read ini files) must be run from an object.
During -all- initiation events, CF will activate -all- objects placed in zCFInitActRefCell.
It is recommended that the scripts of these objects use the Init functions so that they do not run at each initiation event.

**Form Maps
Form maps are maps that use FormIDs as keys.
Because FormIDs change (ie whenever mod load order is changed), it is important to resolve them as necessary.
There are 8 types
These next 3 FormMap types use this format: FormMap[svHexModIndexAsAString][svLast6DigitsOfFormIDAsAString]
These types are your standard Stringmaps. Best to use if you rarely access items by key.
 1 - Stream(Resolve)
 2 - RawStream(ResolveRaw)
 3 - List(Whipe)
These next 3 FormMap types use this format: FormMap[iDecModIndex][iLast6DigitsOfFormIDAsADecNumeral]
These types take less processing power to access items by key, but require an initial chunk of space in the SaveData.
 4 - NumericFormMap(Resolve)
 5 - NumericFormMap(ResolveRaw)
 6 - NumericFormMap(Whipe)
These next 2 FormMap types use this format: FormMap[iLast6DigitsOfFormIDAsADecNumeral]
These types take less processing power to access items by key, but require that the ModIndex can be assumed.
Because ModIndices are not recorded, resolutions are unnecessary.
 7 - QuasiFormMap(NoWhipe)
 8 - QuasiFormMap(Whipe)
